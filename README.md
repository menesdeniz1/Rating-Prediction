The goal of this project was to implement a collaborative filtering algorithm that predicts the 
rating that a user would give to a movie based on the ratings of the movie given by other users. 
Collaborative filtering algorithms are commonly used in recommendation systems to suggest 
items (e.g., movies, books, music) to users based on the preferences of similar users.
